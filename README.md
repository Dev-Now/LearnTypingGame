# ThunderTyper Game

I am working on this game because of the need to have a good typing teacher tool that is at the same time fun for children.

I taught myself how to use the keyboard and type. 
I learned it the wrong way. And even though I got fast enough to type large texts in a relatively normal amount of time, I am today always impressed by the ability to type without looking at the keyboard.
I also have the conviction that I can reach much higher typing speed than my current one and enjoy it more, if only I manage to learn how to type the right way.
I want to learn again typing the right way. And, I mainly want to teach my children typing correctly from the start - so that they don't reproduce my same "mistake".

This project's goal is to make an interesting challenging game - with levels, challenging exercices and scores computed based on typing speed that are saved and compared to other users' scores.

The idea came to me when I came across this interesting website [Learn Typing](www.learntyping.org). 
This website is obviously teaching adults not children how to type. It's going to be boring to send a child to do typing exercices on it regularly.
On the other hand, a game with scores and certain special effects should be fun (Not as fun as a Mario Kart type of game, one would argue! But it teaches while playing...)
I thought I could use this great website's lessons and exercices (along with its explanations simplified for children) as an inspiration to make this game...

Hope it works well...

## Getting Started

The project is still at an early stage of development.
